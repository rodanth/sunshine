        <h1>A tribute to a shining soul</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever met someone that resembled you of the Sun? That person that, no matter what happened, was able to give you a big smile and say something good about you. Someone that could see the good in everything, turn any boring task into a great adventure and transform a simple thought into a task to complete that same day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Someone intelligent, strong, healthy, kind and, of course stunningly beautiful. That person that would encourage you to be the best version of yourself, not for their sake, but because you want to be just like them. Someone you see and think to yourself: when I grow up, I want to be just like them!. That person that would listen to any story you tell with maximum focus, like you're telling the secret to happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Someone you go to sleep thinking about, not because you're in love, but because you get to see that face again tomorrow. That person that makes you love them without falling in love. I can no longer see that face in real life. Pictures, that is all I get to see. Make no mistake, they are not dead, they're just moving on with their life. It's not like the Sun exists just for me, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sun moves on, brightening everyone without a care in the world. All there is left are memories, or pictures, since we're in the 21st century.
